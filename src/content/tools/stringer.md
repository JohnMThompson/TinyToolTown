Codebase archaeology for [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads). Mine your repo for actionable work items, output them as Beads-formatted issues, and give your AI agents instant situational awareness.

Stringer was built with agents, for agents.  It offloads deterministic work like repository analysis to local CPUs, saving inference costs for more valuable creative tasks.  

It also allows agents and humans to utilize agentic planning workflows on legacy codebases.
