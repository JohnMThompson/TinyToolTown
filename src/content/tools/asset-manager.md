I just really wanted an expense tracker app that really works, easy to use and faster to upload expanses in a batch. With a plus that you can manage expanses with your partner. The main features are:

Multi-User Support: Multiple users with independent data isolation
User Registration: Public registration for new users
User Authentication: Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
Asset Tracking: Add monthly income and expense entries manually
Data Visualization: Interactive charts showing asset progression, income vs expenses, and expense categories
Advanced Filtering: Filter entries by date range, transaction type, and categories
Sortable Columns: Click table headers to sort by any column
Data Management: Edit and delete existing entries
Encrypted Storage: All data encrypted at rest using AES-256-CBC
